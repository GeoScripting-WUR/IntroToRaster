* Real world example
** Data from USGS as they come

## Step by step 

* Identify RED, NIR, and fmask layers using `list.file()`
** `list.files(dir, pattern = glob2rx('*band3*.tif'), full.names = TRUE)`
** `list.files(dir, pattern = glob2rx('*fmask*.tif'), full.names = TRUE)`
* (Calculate NDVI -> apply cloud mask) * 2
* Crop to intersecting extent
** `intersect()`
* Substract the two layers


* No need to stack
*
